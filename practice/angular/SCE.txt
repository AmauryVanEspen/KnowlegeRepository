/**

 * @kind function
 * `$sce` is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.
 *
 * # Strict Contextual Escaping
 *
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain
 * contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.  One example of
 * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer
 * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.
 *
 * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.
 *
 * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE8 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE8 allows
 * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer
 * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.
 * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`
 * to the top of your HTML document.
 *
 * SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for
 * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.
 *
 * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *     <input ng-model="userHtml">
 *     <div ng-bind-html="userHtml">
 * </pre>
 *
 * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE
 * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.
 * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via
 * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates
 * security vulnerabilities.)
 *
 * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
 * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.
 *
 * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
 * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
 * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
 * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?
 *
 * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
 * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
 * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
 * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
 * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
 * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
 * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.
 *
 * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}
 * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to
 * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.
 *
 *
 * ## How does it work?
 *
 * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted
 * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link
 * ng.$sce#parse $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the
 * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.
 *
 * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly
 * simplified):
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
 *     return function(scope, element, attr) {
 *       scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {
 *         element.html(value || '');
 *       });
 *     };
 *   }];
 * </pre>
 *
 * ## Impact on loading templates
 *
 * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as
 * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.
 *
 * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application
 * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
 * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or
 * protocols, you may either either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist
 * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.
 *
 * *Please note*:
 * The browser's
 * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
 * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
 * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully
 * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain
 * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some
 * browsers.
 *
 * ## This feels like too much overhead for the developer?
 *
 * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.
 *
 * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to
 * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.
 * `<div ng-bind-html="'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'"></div>`) just works.
 *
 * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them
 * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.
 *
 * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
 * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.
 * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https
 * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.
 *
 * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an
 * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting
 * security onto an application later.

 * ## What trusted context types are supported?
 *
 * | Context             | Notes          |
 * |---------------------|----------------|
 * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |
 * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |
 * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |
 * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 *
 * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name="resourceUrlPatternItem"></a>
 *
 *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:
 *
 *  - **'self'**
 *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same
 *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.
 *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)
 *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource
 *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)
 *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters
 *      match themselves.
 *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6
 *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and ';'.  It's a useful wildcard for use
 *      in a whitelist.
 *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not
 *      not appropriate to use in for a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.
 *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might
 *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.
 *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).
 *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)
 *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax
 *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to
 *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should
 *      have good test coverage.).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a
 *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a
 *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It
 *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions
 *      if they as a last resort.
 *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is
 *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested
 *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags
 *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.
 *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not
 *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),
 *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than
 *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated
 *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good
 *      enough before coding your own.  e.g. Ruby has
 *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)
 *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).
 *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google
 *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](
 *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).

 * ## Show me an example using SCE.
 *
 * @example
<example module="mySceApp" deps="angular-sanitize.js">
<file name="index.html">
  <div ng-controller="myAppController as myCtrl">
    <i ng-bind-html="myCtrl.explicitlyTrustedHtml" id="explicitlyTrustedHtml"></i><br><br>
    <b>User comments</b><br>
    By default, HTML that isn't explicitly trusted (e.g. Alice's comment) is sanitized when
    $sanitize is available.  If $sanitize isn't available, this results in an error instead of an
    exploit.
    <div class="well">
      <div ng-repeat="userComment in myCtrl.userComments">
        <b>{{userComment.name}}</b>:
        <span ng-bind-html="userComment.htmlComment" class="htmlComment"></span>
        <br>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</file>

<file name="script.js">
  var mySceApp = angular.module('mySceApp', ['ngSanitize']);

  mySceApp.controller("myAppController", function myAppController($http, $templateCache, $sce) {
    var self = this;
    $http.get("test_data.json", {cache: $templateCache}).success(function(userComments) {
      self.userComments = userComments;
    });
    self.explicitlyTrustedHtml = $sce.trustAsHtml(
        '<span onmouseover="this.textContent=&quot;Explicitly trusted HTML bypasses ' +
        'sanitization.&quot;">Hover over this text.</span>');
  });
</file>

<file name="test_data.json">
[
  { "name": "Alice",
    "htmlComment":
        "<span onmouseover='this.textContent=\"PWN3D!\"'>Is <i>anyone</i> reading this?</span>"
  },
  { "name": "Bob",
    "htmlComment": "<i>Yes!</i>  Am I the only other one?"
  }
]
</file>

<file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
  describe('SCE doc demo', function() {
    it('should sanitize untrusted values', function() {
      expect(element(by.css('.htmlComment')).getInnerHtml())
          .toBe('<span>Is <i>anyone</i> reading this?</span>');
    });

    it('should NOT sanitize explicitly trusted values', function() {
      expect(element(by.id('explicitlyTrustedHtml')).getInnerHtml()).toBe(
          '<span onmouseover="this.textContent=&quot;Explicitly trusted HTML bypasses ' +
          'sanitization.&quot;">Hover over this text.</span>');
    });
  });
</file>
</example>

 *
 *
 * ## Can I disable SCE completely?
 *
 * Yes, you can.  However, this is strongly discouraged.  SCE gives you a lot of security benefits
 * for little coding overhead.  It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and
 * either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage.  It might make sense to disable SCE
 * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and
 * you're migrating them a module at a time.
 *
 * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *   angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {
 *     // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!
 *     // Do not use in new projects.
 *     $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 *   });
 * </pre>
 *
