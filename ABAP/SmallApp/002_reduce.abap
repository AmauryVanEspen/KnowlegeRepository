While VALUE and NEW expressions can include FOR expressions, REDUCE must include at 
least one FOR expression. You can use all kinds of FOR expressions in REDUCE:
with IN for iterating internal tables
with UNTIL or WHILE for conditional iterations.

* 1,11,21,31 ... 91
* First, the table is filled with VALUE and FOR and then it is reduced with REDUCE
* to the sum of its contents. Note that there is no THEN used to construct the table.
* If THEN is not specified explicitly, implicitly THEN j = j + 1 is used. Be also
* aware, that you can place any expression behind THEN, including method calls.
* You only have to make sure that the end condition is reached within maximal
* program run time.
